# Smart Greenhouse

Smart green house is the final project of Industrial Automation course at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

### Overview

This project is an IoT-based project implemented on esp32 and esp8266 boards and various sensors.
In this project, we collect the telemetry data related to a greenhouse and send them to IoT platforms like thingsboard. The sensor's data are observed in real-time and if they exceed the predefined threshold, an alert will arise.
